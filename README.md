# Hardest langs to do (in my opinion...) [AS OF 11/23/2022]:

## 1: [Wenyan](https://github.com/livxy/Bruhs-in-50-languages/blob/master/EsotericLangs/bruh.wy) (.wy)<br>
A. The language is basically JavaScript in Old Mandrain.<br>
B. I don't speak Mandrain/Chinese.<br>
C. The language was extremely hard to translate as Chinese to English is still an issue to translate to this day.<br>
D. Documentation in English was pretty much 0, if there was anything the English was very broken.

# Most Confusing Languages:

ok so imagine a language that is entirely made visually using nodes. yes nodes. once again language barrier is an issue,<br>
and most of the documentation is broken english because of Polish/Russian even though the creator is Irish?<br>
It's all really confusing and not only that, the GUI is AWFUL. I mean REALLY bad.
